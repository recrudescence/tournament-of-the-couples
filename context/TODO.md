the following is a list of todo items i want to implement.

- game design
	- rounds should have _variants_. 
		- variants include:
			1. open ended: prompt + short answer (currently implemented)
			2. multiple choice: prompt + n options (radio boxes)
				- the host can choose how many responses: defaults to 2 text fields for them to input the choice, with a button to add another choice. next to each choice there is a 'remove choice' button.
			3. binary: prompt + 2 options (radio boxes)
				- binary is effectively multiple choice but with only 2 options
				- the options are prefilled with player1's name and player2's name 
		- when host is in Round Setup, they should be able to _choose_ which variant they'd like the round to be.

- game ux
	- generally, the front end client display should be optimized to be responsive layouts. something to keep in mind is that most players will view the game on a mobile device, while the host will usually (but not always) be on a desktop.

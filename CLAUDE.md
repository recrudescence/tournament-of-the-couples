# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Workflow

- Prioritize efficient token usage wherever possible
- Avoid excessively praising the user's decisions or ideas - be to the point, thoughtfully questioning, and critical of any design or decisions that may lead to messy or poorly architected code

## Project-specific context

Specific context around the project, gameplay, architecture, and patterns can be found in the following documents. These documents should be updated when necessary to ensure they are up to date with the current state of the code.
- context/architecture.md: a detailed look at the architecture and data flow of the game
- context/gameplay.md: Tournament of the Couples gameplay
- context/patterns.md: common patterns in the code
- context/stack.md: tech stack notes
- context/state.md: database schema and gameplay state
- context/TODO.md: to-do items for future state, features, and plans for the project

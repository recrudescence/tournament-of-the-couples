## Project Overview

Tournament of the Couples is a real-time multiplayer party game where pairs of players (teams) answer questions about each other. A host manages the game flow, asks questions, and awards points based on how well partners' answers match.

**Gameplay Flow:**
1. Players join and form pairs (teams) in the lobby
2. Host asks questions (e.g., "What's your partner's favorite movie?")
3. Each player answers independently without seeing their partner's answer
4. Host reveals both partners' answers one team at a time
5. Host decides if answers match well enough to award a point
6. Process repeats for multiple rounds until host ends the game
